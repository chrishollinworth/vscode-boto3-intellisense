# vscode-boto3-intellisense

Enables boto3 intellisense using pylance with [mypy_boto3_builder](https://github.com/vemel/mypy_boto3_builder)

Works with vscode when python or pylance extensions are installed

[ms-python.python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)

Logic
1. Install dependencies
2. Creates and activate a virtualenv
3. Generates the stubs, installs them
4. Copys stubs into typings folder ready for pyright 

Ctrl + Space to trigger a suggestion!

## Notes 

**build script must be run in scripts folder**

type stubs for pylance/pyright can be regenerated by running 

```
cd scripts
./buildstubs.sh
```

Tested on ubuntu
