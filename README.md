# vscode-pyright-boto3-stubs-intellisense

Enables boto3 intellisense using pyright with [boto3-stubs](https://pypi.org/project/boto3-stubs/).

Logic
Install dependencies
Creates and activate a virtualenv, then install all the stubs:
Generates the stubs
Copys stubs into typings folder

## Notes

**build script must be run in scripts folder**

cd 

[typings/](typings/) can be regenerated by running 
`./buildstubs.sh`.
