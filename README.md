Enables boto3 intellisense using pyright with [boto3-stubs](https://pypi.org/project/boto3-stubs/).

Logic

Creates and activate a virtualenv, then install all the stubs:
Generates the stubs
Copys stubs into typings folder

## Notes

**build script must be run in scripts folder**

type stubs for pylance/pyright can be regenerated by running 
`cd typings`
`./buildstubs.sh`.

Only tested on ubuntu
